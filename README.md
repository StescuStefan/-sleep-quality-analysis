# Sleep Quality and Lifestyle Factors Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project examining the relationships between sleep quality, stress levels, and various lifestyle factors using a public dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
- Analyzed factors influencing sleep quality including stress, physical activity, heart rate, and pre-existing sleep disorders
- Conducted extensive statistical analysis in both Python and R to validate findings
- Implemented various statistical methods: hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling

## Technical Implementation
- Performed data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering
- Used visualization techniques to identify patterns and outliers
- Implemented both linear and non-linear regression models
- Conducted chi-square tests, ANOVA, and correlation analyses
- Validated statistical assumptions using tests for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation

## Key Findings
- Identified significant correlations between stress levels and sleep quality
- Discovered relationships between physical activity and sleep duration
- Determined statistical differences in stress patterns based on sleep disorder types

## Technologies Used
- Python: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- R: tidyverse, dplyr, psych, stats packages
