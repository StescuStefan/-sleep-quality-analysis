# Sleep Quality and Lifestyle Factors Analysis

A data analysis project examining the relationships between sleep quality, stress levels, and various lifestyle factors using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
- Analysis of factors influencing sleep quality (stress, physical activity, pre-existing sleep disorders)
- Implementation of statistical analysis in both Python and R
- Application of statistical methods to identify correlations and influences

## Technical Implementation
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Creation of categorical variables from numerical data
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (histograms, boxplots)
- Statistical tests (chi-square, Bartlett's, t-test, ANOVA)
- Correlation analysis (Pearson, Spearman)
- Simple and multiple linear regression models
- Second-order non-linear regression model
- Testing regression model hypotheses

## Key Findings
- Relationships between stress levels and sleep quality
- Differences in stress patterns based on sleep disorder types
- Impact of physical activity on sleep duration

## Technologies Used
- Python: pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
- R: tidyverse, dplyr, psych, stats packages
